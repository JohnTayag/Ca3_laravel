            It all began back in 2012 when it dawned on us just how slim the pickings were for one who 
            desired beautiful, ethical beauty and fashion. We’d spend hours perusing in various boutiques, 
            trying to find something cruelty-free that excited us, but we regularly ran into the same 
            disappointing realizations — that animal skins, sweatshop labor, and toxic ingredients 
            were (and unfortunately still are) the norm. On the rare occasion when we’d stumble upon 
            something free of those things, more often than not, the find was lackluster. Frustrated 
            with the nonexistence of a shop that reflected both contemporary style and progressive ideals, 
            we set out to create the space ourselves. We wanted an uplifting, authentic retail brand 
            that embodied our sophisticated style and joyful spirit and made shopping cruelty-free 
            effortless. So, we quit our day jobs in education and retail and launched Petit Vour.
